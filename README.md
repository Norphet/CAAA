Cell_Arrangement_AI_Algorithm

The program is develepoed to calcualte a valid route for cell assembly,
with physical constraints in mind.

USER INPUT: need to give:
Matric size: n*n size symmetric or asymmetric type of matrix n=integer
Obstacles: do we want to have invlaid cell places? simulating advanced 
geometrical arrangements.
Cell type: What kind of cells will our system use? avaliable options 
will be presented.

IMPORTANT: This feature is still in development, for the sake of visual 
clarity and time investment, there are elements simplified, and yet to 
implemented, this product is a tech. demo
